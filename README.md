# battleship
command line battleship game against AI


This was a project completed as a first semester computer science student in C. For fun, I recently rewrote the program in the "improved"
branch to compare my coding style from two years ago to today. The original code is in the master branch. The improved code should be ran in a bash shell and the original code in command prompt.
