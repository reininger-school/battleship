	over the enemy fleet. You will alternate taking shots with the enemy, with the goal of
	sinking all of the enemy ships before the same is done to you. Before the battle, you
	may coordinate the position of your ships (place ships manually) or allow your trusted
	captains to choose the best strategic positions (place ships randomly). Once your armada
	is in place, the battle will commence.Two grids will be displayed: the first details
	infomation you have about your enemy, while the second shows the position and status of
	your own armada. You each have sophisticated cloaking mechanisms, and so must fire
	randomly in the enemies general direction (by selecting row and column coordinates) only
	learning if the projectile found its target (represnted by a "*") or landed harmlessly in
	the sea (represented by an "m"). The battle is won or lost when all of the ships on one
	side have been destroyed. Good luck Admiral!
